# Execution Status

Coordinator-owned file. Coding agents MUST NOT edit this file unless explicitly assigned the coordinator role.

Last initialized: 2026-09-24

## Current phase

- Active execution model: **P00**
- Next implementable phase: **P01**
- Current Contract Gate: **not started**
- Shared-file owner: **unassigned**
- Integration owner: **unassigned**

## Phase status

| Phase | State | Contract Gate | Integration Gate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P00 | active | n/a | n/a | execution mechanics operationalized |
| P01 | ready | not started | not started | next phase |
| P02 | blocked | blocked | blocked | waits for P01 |
| P03 | blocked | blocked | blocked | waits for P02 |
| P04 | blocked | blocked | blocked | waits for P02 |
| P05 | blocked | blocked | blocked | waits for P03 + P04 |
| P06 | blocked | blocked | blocked | waits for P05 |
| P07 | blocked | blocked | blocked | demand/dependency gated |
| P08 | blocked | blocked | blocked | waits for integration foundations |
| P09 | blocked | blocked | blocked | release hardening only |

## Packet status vocabulary

- `ready` — dependency satisfied; not claimed
- `claimed` — one agent owns it
- `in_progress` — implementation underway
- `blocked` — cannot proceed; blocker named
- `review` — PR open and ready
- `merged` — merged to main
- `superseded` — replaced by a new packet/contract
- `cancelled` — intentionally abandoned

## Coordinator responsibilities

The coordinator alone:

- opens/closes phase Contract Gates;
- assigns shared-file ownership;
- keeps packet IDs unique;
- resolves write-surface overlap;
- updates this status board;
- declares Integration Gate readiness;
- decides whether a contract change blocks dependent merges;
- marks phase exit only after the real vertical slice passes.

## Rule

This file is a coordination artifact, not a task log. Keep it compact. Detailed work belongs in issues/PRs using the templates.
